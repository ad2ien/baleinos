This repo holds assets, scripts and documentation of a [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me/) customization meant to be used by french administration or associations that want to offer their users a self attending station for administrative procedures.

## Use cases

### For the users

- be able to use a web browser
  - that respects privacy
  - that has a smooth UX thanks to good performance
- has a button somewhere to delete all traces of the user's visit.

### For the admins

- to be able to use an aging PC
- be able to configure the station to best suit the context of use while preventing end-users from modifying the settings like:
  - bookmarks
  - home page, default search tool...
- be able to set white or black lists of websites
- easily do some further customization : install apps, change UI...

## How does it work?

- the [install script](install-baleinos.sh) creates a linux user that will be auto logged in.
- the taskbar and desktop is simplified
- a private Firefox is launched at startup
- on the admin account, [Baleinos admin tool](admin-assets/baleinos-admin-app/README.md) is installed
